# Hello World
### First java program
> The most basic java project

Every java program needs a **main** method. A **main** method in java needs to be **public** **static** and **void**. It must also take an array of strings as an argument

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

When this program is run, 'Hello World' will be printed.
